- **5/6**: Adjust Damping
- **7/8**: Adjust Time Scale
- **9**: Toggle Boundaries (wrap/bounce)
- **Spacebar**: Reset Particle Positions
- **Q/W**: Change Number of Particle Types (2-8)
- **E/R**: Adjust Minimum Distance
- **T/Y**: Adjust Mouse Repulsion Strength
- **C**: Cycle Colour Schemes
- **M**: Randomize Attraction Matrix
- **H**: Show Help
- **P**: Print Current Values

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Executable 
(Not Recommended: Limited functionality, certain config values are unable to be tweaked i.e: particle count)
**[Download Emergence.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q5e6ffPFukoZbqiuyIuZ7MAdUv_aEKHU/view?usp=sharing)** - Single file, the simple way!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice**: Your antivirus may show warnings because this is an unsigned executable. This is normal for indie software. The complete source code is available below for verification.

**System Requirements:**
- Windows 10/11
- OpenGL 3.3+ compatible graphics card
- ~80MB disk space

Simply download and double-click to run!

### Option 2: Run from Source
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CurvyAura/Emergence.git
   cd Emergence
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install moderngl moderngl-window numpy
   ```

3. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

### Particle "Life"
The emergent behaviors arise from these simple rules:

1. **Attraction/Repulsion**: Each particle type has different relationships with others
2. **Distance-Based Forces**: Force strength varies with distance (repulsion when close, attraction at medium range)
3. **Minimum Distance**: Particles maintain separation to prevent overlap
4. **Boundary Conditions**: Particles can wrap around edges or bounce off walls

### GPU Acceleration
The simulation uses OpenGL compute shaders for:
- Parallel force calculations between all particle pairs
- Real-time position and velocity updates
- Efficient memory management for large particle counts

## Configuration

Key parameters can be adjusted in `config.py`:
- `NUM_PARTICLES`: Number of particles (default: 20,000)
- `NUM_TYPES`: Number of particle types (default: 6)
- `FORCE_FACTOR`: Overall force strength (default: 0.5)
- `MIN_DISTANCE`: Minimum separation distance (default: 0.03)
- `REPULSION_STRENGTH`: Anti-overlap force strength (default: 2.0)

## Discovering Emergent Behaviors

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 2-3 particle types
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Use number keys to modify physics
3. **Add Complexity**: Increase types with Q/W keys
4. **Randomize**: Press M to generate new attraction matrices
5. **Experiment**: Try different combinations and observe patterns

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Graphics**: ModernGL (OpenGL 4.3+)
- **Compute**: GPU shaders for parallel processing
- **Performance**: 60+ FPS with 20,000 particles on modern GPUs

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point
